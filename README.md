# My Marie Curie Proposal
I submitted this proposal in 2023. I have included 
  1. The submitted proposal in pdf (written originally in LibreOffice)
  2. The reviewer comments, so the positives and the negatives of my proposal can be judged better
  3. The TeX file for Gantt chart as this is reusable

My project was not funded, but I received a Seal of Excellence. Feel free to contact me at my institute email (keeps changing) or sancharsharma@gmail.com
